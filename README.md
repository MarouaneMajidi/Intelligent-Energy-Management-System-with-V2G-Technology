## Overview

V2G Optimizer is an advanced energy management solution that leverages Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology to minimize electricity production costs. This project extends a foundational MATLAB/Simulink V2G simulation to model monthly timeframes and incorporates:

- Real-world solar irradiance data from MeknÃ¨s, Morocco
- Custom-generated residential load profiles representative of Moroccan consumption patterns
- Comprehensive cost optimization algorithms

Our Streamlit-based web application provides weekly forecasts to help decision-makers determine the optimal balance between utilizing stored EV energy via V2G technology versus supplementing with diesel generation during peak demand periods.

## V2G Explained

### What is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)?

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is a cutting-edge technology enabling bidirectional energy flow between electric vehicle batteries and the power grid. Unlike conventional EV charging, V2G allows vehicles to not only consume electricity but also return it to the grid when beneficial.

### How It Works

![V2G Process Flow](https://i.imgur.com/placeholder2.jpg)

When connected to a V2G-enabled charging station, the system manages electricity flow through:

1. **Charging Mode:** The EV draws power from the grid to charge its battery
2. **Discharging (V2G) Mode:** The EV feeds stored energy back to the grid when:
   - Grid demand peaks 
   - Energy prices are high
   - Renewable energy generation is low

This process is coordinated through sophisticated control systems with EV owner consent, typically including financial incentives for participation.

### V2G Use Cases

V2G technology offers multiple benefits across the energy ecosystem:

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Peak Shaving** | Reduces grid strain during high-demand periods by supplying stored EV energy |
| **Grid Stabilization** | Provides ancillary services like frequency regulation and voltage support |
| **Renewable Integration** | Stores surplus renewable energy for use when generation is insufficient |
| **Emergency Backup** | Offers potential backup power during outages |
| **Economic Optimization** | Creates revenue opportunities for EV owners through energy arbitrage |

Our project specifically focuses on cost optimization by determining when V2G utilization is more economical than alternative generation sources.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Simulation Timeframe:** Extended MATLAB/Simulink model for monthly energy analysis (vs. original 24-hour scope)
- **Localized Data Integration:**
  - Actual solar irradiation data from MeknÃ¨s, Morocco
  - Realistic residential load profiles mirroring Moroccan consumption patterns
- **Advanced Optimization Engine:** Cost-minimization algorithms to determine optimal energy sourcing strategies
- **Interactive Decision Support:** Streamlit application providing:
  - Weekly energy forecasts
  - Cost-comparison between V2G and diesel generation
  - Actionable recommendations for energy management
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** Data visualization and insights on load patterns, solar production, and V2G availability
